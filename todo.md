## Would be used by Manager/WFM to verify employee actually worked today

<!-- -- Connect Clock in and Out to DB -->

-- React/Redux Context on if clocked in or not
-- Main page should display Today and Tomorrows schedule
-- Main page should also most recent hours worked (last 3 days ish) and any special "company" wide annoucements (either banner or own component)

## Used by employee to see when they worked - updated by WFM

-- Create schedule component
-- ^ Calendar of month showing days to work and time (something like google/apple calendar layout)

## On Submit this goes to WFM and they verify and give the stamp of approval - Admin Dashboard type deal

-- Time sheet should be like a table where each day you input hours
-- Different "aux codes" like PTO - REGULAR - VACATION - SICK and etc
